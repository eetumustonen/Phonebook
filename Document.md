This is a really simple phonebook app, but it showcases merging front- and back-end together, using a database and is running online.
The program gives appropriate notifications and works as expected.
The code in this repository is just to showcase the code and architectual structure of the program.

This is a school project so I do not take credit for designing it but I wish to use it to prove that
I have some basic understanding of the methods and languages used in this program.

#### The program is running here:
